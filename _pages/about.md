Hi, welcome to my website! <br />
<br>

I am an Assistant Professor at Harland C. Stonecipher School of Business at East Central University. <br /> <br>

I completed my Ph.D. in Economics from the University of Oklahoma (OU) in Spring 2024. I work on applied macro issues focusing on political economy, development, and public economics. <br />

<br>

In my free time, I like to read, play Xbox, or make travel plans with my family.  <br />
